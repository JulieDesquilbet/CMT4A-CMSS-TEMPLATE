# Instructions

## Getting Ready
1. In RStudio, start a new R Project by clicking the *Create a project* button: ![Create a project](../imgs/rstudio_proj.png?raw=true "Create a project")
2. Select *"Version Control"* then *"Git"*.
3. In *"Repository URL"*, paste the URL of your challenge GitHub repository (See this [**IMAGE**](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Copy-repo-URL-to-clipboard.png.pagespeed.ce.OoaKTWf-H_.png)). It will be something like https://github.com/your_username/name-of-the-repo.git.
4. Accept the default project directory which will be the same as the GitHub repo name.
5. Choose where you want to save the project on your computer.
6. Click "Create Project".

    - You should find yourself in a new local (on your computer) RStudio Project with the contents of the challenge folder that was created by GitHub. You should see the files at bottom right part of RStudio.

7. In the "Files" browser (bottom right), open the *"project" > "requirements.R"* file.
    - The new file should appear open in the top left pane of RStudio.
8. Source the file by clicking ![Source](../imgs/rstudio_source.png?raw=true "Source the contents of the active document")
    - This will install some packages that will provide new functionality to R. It can take around ~10-15minutes to finish depending on how fast your internet connection and computer are.
    - Once it's done, you can close the `requirements.R` file in RStudio.
9. In the "Files" browser (bottom right), open the *"project" > "project.Rmd"* file.
    - The new file should appear open in the top left pane of RStudio.
    - Render the file by clicking (![Knit the document](../imgs/rstudio_knit.png?raw=true "Knit the document"))
    - A PDF file should appear.
    - Get familiar with this process, we will do this A LOT!
